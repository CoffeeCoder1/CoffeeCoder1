- 👋 Hi, I’m @CoffeeCoder1
- 👀 I’m interested in mechanical and electrical engineering
- 🌱 I’m currently not really learning anything specific - more just working on a few miscellaneous projects and organizing my work area
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on manufacturing/mass producing products
- 📫 You can probably contact me somewhere (maybe on GitHub somehow or something)
