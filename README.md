- 👋 Hi, I’m CoffeeDev!
- 👀 I’m interested in mechanical and electrical engineering as well as various musical things and photography/cinematography.
- 🌱 I’m currently not really learning anything specific - more just working on a few miscellaneous projects.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on manufacturing/mass producing products, and if someone knows how to write some firmware for a camera gimbal that would be pretty helpful.
- 📫 You can send me an E-Mail at the email address listed on my GitHub profile, or send me a Matrix message to my Matrix account, which can be found on [my website](https://coffeecoder1.github.io/).
