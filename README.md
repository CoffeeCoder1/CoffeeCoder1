- 👋 Hi, I’m CoffeeDev!
- 👀 I’m interested in electrical engineering as well as various musical things, photography, and cinematography.
- 🌱 I’m interested in learning more Rust and more about real-time audio-over-IP stuff (particularly AES67).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on writing some software for AES67.
- 📫 You can send me an E-Mail at the email address listed on my GitHub profile, or send me a Matrix message to my Matrix account, which can be found on [my website](https://coffeecoder1.github.io/).
